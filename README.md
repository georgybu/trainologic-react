## Goal

compare angular1 and react solutions

## The Task ##
Below is a tree of contacts and groups. A contact has an id and a name. A group represents a collection of groups and contacts. id is unique across the whole tree

```javascript 1.8
var contacts = [
    {
        id:1,
        name: "Friends",
        type: "Group",
        contacts: [
            {id:2, name: "Udi", type: "Contact"},
            {id:3, name: "Tommy", type: "Contact"},
            {
                id:6,
                name: "Old Friends",
                type: "Group",
                contacts: [
                    {id:7, name: "Itay", type: "Contact"},
                ]
            },
        ]
    },
    {
        id:4,
        name: "Family",
        type: "Group",
        contacts: [
            {id:5, name: "Roni", type: "Contact"},
        ]
    },
    {id: 8, name: "Ori", type: "Contact"},
];
```
Your task is to create an angular 1 application which displays a tree of contacts and allow the end user to expand each group and see its children items

For example, when running the application all groups are collapsed

Once the end user clicks the “Friends” group it is expanded as below

The user can expand any group. This time is the “Old Friends” group

An expanded group can be collapsed by clicking it again

A group that is collapsed should not incur any overhead (DOM and angular). That means that a collapsed group’s children are not part of the DOM and are created/destroyed per user click

You should implement the same look & feel (CSS) as described by the screen shots above
